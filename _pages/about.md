I am a Ph.D. student at the Physics Department of McGill University in the Nuclear Theory group working on aspects of hydrodynamic modeling in heavy-ion collisions. I am also a STEM Graduate Teaching Development Fellow, an organizing committee member of the [McGill Physics Hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/), and a former VP Communications of the McGill Graduate Association of Physics Students.

When I get the chance, I enjoy working on various side projects, taking photographs around Montreal, skating, playing hockey, and looking for opportunities to go hiking. I also played on one of the departmental intramural hockey teams, the Absolute Zeroes, prior to its disbanding. I am also a violist, having performed as a soloist, member of a small ensemble, and of orchestras in both Scotland and the United States. This musical work involved the east coast premiere of a new work by Mark O'Connor: [W&M's Gallery Players present Elevations for String Orchestra by Mark O'Connor; First Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiyDXNJtLfc) .

I additionally spend arguably too much time reading Wikipedia articles; one of my favorites is on the [Habeas Corpus Act 1679](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_Corpus_Act_1679).

Research
======

I am a Ph.D. student in the Nuclear Theory group at McGill under the supervision of [Charles Gale](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~gale/Charles_Gale/Charles_Gale.html) working on various aspects of modeling hydrodynamic behavior in hot and dense hadronic matter.

*What is hot and dense hadronic matter?* Hot and dense hadronic matter (also known as Quark-Gluon Plasma) is a phase of matter where what normally makes up atomic nuclei has "melted". This highly energetic phase of matter exhibits collective behavior, allowing it to be modeled as a relativistic fluid. It is possible to produce QGP at particle colliders by colliding atomic nuclei, such as two lead or gold nuclei together at speeds comparable to the speed of light. This is done at terrestrial colliders, such as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven or the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva.

I have also worked on computational applications in low-energy nuclear systems and aspects of beyond Standard Model physics. This research sought to explore if extra degrees of freedom were present in the immediately post-Big Bang universe. Limits on this exotic physics can be probed using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which is how elements were formed in the early universe. Computational tests of variation yield strict limits on variation of "fundamental" Standard Model constants.

I am partially supported at McGill as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Previously, I was a lab marker for the Physics 101 course as well as an exam marker for the Physics 102 course here at McGill. I also led tutorial sessions for Physics 201: Dynamics of Simple Systems. Currently, I am working with [Nikolas Provatas](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~provatas/.index.html) as a STEM Graduate Teaching Development Fellow, working to flip the classroom McGill's large Physics 102 course. This involves writing new and challenging questions for students to solve, providing clear solutions, and recording select problem solutions. I am currently extending this work with plans to lecture in two weekly tutorial sessions.

Research Experience
======
**Graduate Research Assistant** - *McGill University* (2016-Present)  
Graduate Research Assistant in the Nuclear Theory group under the direction of Charles Gale studying relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

**Undergraduate Student Researcher** - *The College of William & Mary* (2013-2016)  
Undergraduate honors thesis using computational methods (Python, Fortran) to probe Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for limits on Beyond Standard Model physics. This work was performed under the direction of [Andre Walker-Loud](http://ntc0.lbl.gov/~walkloud/).

**Stirling Cycle Analyst for Nuclear Space Power Applications** - *NASA Glenn Research Center* (2015)  
LERCIP Intern with the Thermal Energy Conversion Branch working to improve model fidelity and performing simulations for the Test Demonstration Unit (TDU) for the pre-testing Test Readiness Review. Additional work was done to optimize Stirling engines to map power density-efficiency space and customize the piston-displacer waveform. Future applications of this work include deep space and space exploration applications as passive power units

**REU Student** - *Texas A&M University and Cyclotron Institute* (2014)  
National Science Foundation (US)-funded studentship under Ralf Rapp studying hot and dense hadronic matter, resulting in a state-of-the-art parametrization of thermal photon production in hadronic matter.
