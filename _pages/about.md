I am a Ph.D. student at the Physics Department of McGill University in the Nuclear Theory group working on aspects of hydrodynamic modeling in heavy-ion collisions. I am also a STEM Graduate Teaching Development Fellow, an organizing committee member of the [McGill Physics Hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/), and a former VP Communications of the McGill Graduate Association of Physics Students.

When I get the chance, I enjoy working on various side projects, taking photographs around Montreal, skating, playing hockey, and looking for opportunities to go hiking. I also played on one of the departmental intramural hockey teams, the Absolute Zeroes, prior to its disbanding. I am also a violist, having performed as a soloist, member of a small ensemble, and of orchestras in both Scotland and the United States. This musical work involved the east coast premiere of a new work by Mark O'Connor: [W&M's Gallery Players present Elevations for String Orchestra by Mark O'Connor; First Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiyDXNJtLfc) .

I additionally spend arguably too much time reading Wikipedia articles; one of my favorites is on the [Habeas Corpus Act 1679](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_Corpus_Act_1679).

Research
======

I am a Ph.D. student in the Nuclear Theory group at McGill under the supervision of [Charles Gale](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~gale/Charles_Gale/Charles_Gale.html) working on various aspects of modeling hydrodynamic behavior in hot and dense hadronic matter.

*What is hot and dense hadronic matter?* Hot and dense hadronic matter (also known as Quark-Gluon Plasma) is a phase of matter where what normally makes up atomic nuclei has "melted". This highly energetic phase of matter exhibits collective behavior, allowing it to be modeled as a relativistic fluid. It is possible to produce QGP at particle colliders by colliding atomic nuclei, such as two lead or gold nuclei together at speeds comparable to the speed of light. This is done at terrestrial colliders, such as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven or the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva.

I have also worked on computational applications in low-energy nuclear systems and aspects of beyond Standard Model physics. This research sought to explore if extra degrees of freedom were present in the immediately post-Big Bang universe. Limits on this exotic physics can be probed using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which is how elements were formed in the early universe. Computational tests of variation yield strict limits on variation of "fundamental" Standard Model constants.

I am partially supported at McGill as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Previously, I was a lab marker for the Physics 101 course as well as an exam marker for the Physics 102 course here at McGill. I also led tutorial sessions for Physics 201: Dynamics of Simple Systems. Currently, I am working with [Nikolas Provatas](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~provatas/.index.html) as a STEM Graduate Teaching Development Fellow, working to flip the classroom McGill's large Physics 102 course. This involves writing new and challenging questions for students to solve, providing clear solutions, and recording select problem solutions. I am currently extending this work with plans to lecture in two weekly tutorial sessions.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
