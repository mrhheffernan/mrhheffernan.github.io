Education
======
* B.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics, The College of William & Mary, 2016
* M.Sc. in Physics, McGill University, 2018
* Ph.D. in Theoretical Nuclear Physics, McGill University, 2022 (expected)

Research Experience
======
* **Graduate Research Assistant** - *McGill University* (2016-Present)  
  * Graduate Research Assistant in the Nuclear Theory group under the direction of Charles Gale studying relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

* **Undergraduate Student Researcher** - *The College of William & Mary* (2013-2016)  
  * Undergraduate honors thesis using computational methods (Python, Fortran) to probe Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for limits on Beyond Standard Model physics. This work was performed under the direction of [Andre Walker-Loud](http://ntc0.lbl.gov/~walkloud/).

* **Stirling Cycle Analyst for Nuclear Space Power Applications** - *NASA Glenn Research Center* (2015)  
  * LERCIP Intern with the Thermal Energy Conversion Branch working to improve model fidelity and performing simulations for the Test Demonstration Unit (TDU) for the pre-testing Test Readiness Review. Additional work was done to optimize Stirling engines to map power density-efficiency space and customize the piston-displacer waveform. Future applications of this work include deep space and space exploration applications as passive power units

* **REU Student** - *Texas A&M University and Cyclotron Institute* (2014)  
  * National Science Foundation (US)-funded studentship under Ralf Rapp studying hot and dense hadronic matter, resulting in a state-of-the-art parametrization of thermal photon production in hadronic matter.
