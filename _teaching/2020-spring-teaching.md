Prepared and gave tutorials to groups of up to 100 students, involving classroom management and coordination of teaching resources. Coordinated delivery with the professor to ensure a uniform experience and managed interactive classroom tools such as TurningPoint for live polling.

Teaching was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and was forced to rapidly re-orient to online learning. Helped the professor transition to an effective online strategy to end the semester.
