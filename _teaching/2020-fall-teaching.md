Worked with professor and other teaching assistants to collaboratively redesign laboratories for the introductory mechanics course at McGill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Led development of a new rolling without slipping laboratory designed to be performed with minimal equipment so as to be easily adaptable to student situations all over the world. Recorded walkthrough videos and led student tutorial sessions and oversaw marking.
