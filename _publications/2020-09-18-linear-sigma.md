We develop frameworks and calculate transport coefficients in the linear sigma model at finite temperature. We use multiple frameworks in order to isolate the impact of approximations on results. Results are shown for different values of the scalar-isoscalar hadron vacuum mass with in-medium masses for the interacting fields. The advantages and limitations of the LSM for studies of strongly interacting matter out of equilibrium are discussed and results are compared with others in the literature.
